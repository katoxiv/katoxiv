## About Me

I combine elite academic credentials—including an M.Sc in Cyber Security Analytics from the University of Exeter and a First-Class B.Sc in Applied Information Technology from the University of ISBAT—with extensive practical experience in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and cloud security. My career is dedicated to:
- **Mitigating risk** by identifying vulnerabilities in networks and systems.
- **Innovating security operations** by integrating advanced SIEM, incident response, and threat-hunting strategies.
- **Optimizing IT infrastructure** through high-performance computing solutions and automation.

When I’m not diving into the latest security challenges, I’m developing innovative tools (like my AI-powered resume optimizer) and collaborating with peers on open-source projects that push the boundaries of cybersecurity and IT efficiency.
